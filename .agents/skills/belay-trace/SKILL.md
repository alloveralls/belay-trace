name: belay-trace
description: Use for Tier 2 or Tier 3 coding work, or whenever a task needs project intent, plans, decisions, delivery status, review context, or trace updates through the local belay CLI. Frame an Intent Brief and Delivery Map before implementation, reconcile them during execution, and assure completion against fresh Evidence.

# belay-trace

## Command reference

Use these forms directly. Do not run `--help` to discover syntax.

```sh
belay context compile "<task>" --format agent --budget 4000   # once per task, at start
belay context "<task>" --format agent --budget 2500           # fallback if compile is unavailable
belay search "<query>"                                        # targeted follow-up discovery
belay show <id>                                               # only when the full entry is needed
belay show <plan-id>#t-001                                    # one task; prefer over the whole Plan
belay show <goal-id>#sc-001                                   # one Success Criterion

## Route runs

Use Route when the human asks to reconstruct one active decision thread into
typed Assessment and Proposal artifacts. Keep semantic reasoning in the agent:

```sh
belay route start --seed <goal-or-plan-id>
belay route template <run-id> assessment
belay route submit <run-id> assessment --file <assessment.json>
belay route template <run-id> proposal
belay route submit <run-id> proposal --file <proposal.json>
belay route template <run-id> response
belay route submit <run-id> response --file <response.json>
belay route preview <run-id>
belay route pending <run-id>
belay route apply <run-id> --approve <exact-preview-hash>
```

- Treat Route Input as the fixed source bundle and Assessment/Proposal as
  advisory. Preserve Fact, Human Observation, Assumption, Hypothesis, Unknown,
  Conflict, and Belay references in their typed fields.
- Convert the human's explicit chat response into Human Response. Never infer
  acceptance, broaden selected operation IDs, or reuse a response after the
  Proposal hash changes.
- After `preview`, call `pending` and present only that one returned Preview's
  run ID, revision, and operation summary to the human. Keep its hash internal.
  Treat ordinary-language approval as valid only when the pending Preview is
  unique, the approval unambiguously targets it, and no later conversation
  changes its scope. Discard the pending binding on a new Preview, changed
  Input/Proposal/Response, an ambiguous reply, a revision request, multiple
  pending approvals, or a material conversational detour; then re-present a
  freshly checked Preview. `pending`/`apply` verify freshness and the exact
  hash, but Route does not authenticate or interpret chat and does not replace
  repository approval gates.
- Run state under `.belay/state/route/` is local and non-authoritative. Accepted
  materialized Belay entries are the durable source of truth.

## Token discipline

- Entry titles must be short English kebab-case, at most 5 words
  (e.g. `t012-bigquery-dry-run`). The display ID embeds the title slug and is
  repeated throughout later context; never use Japanese or long phrases in a
  title. Put the descriptive detail in the entry body instead.
- Write entry bodies as terse bullets. Delete scaffold sections that would
  only say "None." Exception: the Intent Brief's seven sections must stay
  non-empty; write `None identified` there.
- Run `belay context compile` once at task start. For anything after that,
  use `belay search`; do not re-compile at checkpoints.
- Retrieve a fragment, not an entry, when you need one item. `belay show
  <plan-id>#t-003` returns that task's Delivery Map row and its `## T-003`
  section; `belay show <plan-id>` returns every task in the Plan. On a ten-task
  Plan that is roughly an eighth of the output.
  Cheap retrieval is not licence to skip the Intent Brief: a task read alone
  loses the Constraints and Non-goals that make it correct, so read those too
  before acting, and read the whole entry when the work spans tasks.

## Classify the work

- Tier 1 is a small, reversible change with clear scope. A separate Plan is optional.
- Tier 2 includes features and non-trivial changes. Create or update a Goal and Plan before implementation, and give the human an opportunity to correct the Intent Brief.
- Tier 3 includes architecture, API contracts, security, migrations, and irreversible operations. Require explicit human approval of the Intent Brief and Plan before implementation.
- Escalate when scope, reversibility, or risk is uncertain.

## Frame

1. Retrieve context per the command reference. Avoid broad reads of `.belay/entries/` unless a command identifies a specific source path.
2. Draft an Intent Brief in the Plan with non-empty Problem, Desired Outcome, Success Signals, Constraints, Non-goals, Assumptions, and Unknowns / Decisions Needed sections.
3. Separate facts, assumptions, unknowns, and human decisions. Ask before choices that materially change the outcome, affect security or data loss, create external commitments, or are irreversible. Explicitly record and proceed with small, reversible assumptions.

## Map

1. Give each Goal Success Criterion a stable, document-local ID using `SC-NNN`, starting at `SC-001`. Never renumber or reuse an ID.
2. Add a Delivery Map to the Plan with columns: ID, Goal item, Outcome / Task, Actor, State, and Verification / Evidence.
3. Map every Success Criterion to an observable outcome task and a verification task. Explain any task that has no Goal item.
4. Give tasks stable, document-local IDs using `T-NNN`, starting at `T-001`. Never renumber or reuse an ID. Outside the defining document, use fully qualified references such as `GOAL-...#sc-001` and `PLN-...#t-001`.
5. Task states are limited to `not-started`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `implemented`, `verified`, and `dropped`. `implemented` means the change exists; `verified` requires fresh passing Evidence that actually checks the mapped outcome. A test definition is not passing Evidence.
6. Keep dropped tasks visible and record the reason and approval source.
7. Give every task a `## T-NNN` body section in the same Plan. The row is the index and the state; the section is what a reader with no prior context acts on, and it is what `belay show <plan-id>#t-nnn` returns. Carry at least Objective, Scope, Steps, Acceptance, and Verification; add whatever else your workflow needs, since `belay plan lint` ignores fields it does not require. Run `belay plan lint <plan-id>` after drafting or materially editing a Plan.

## Execute

1. Use the Delivery Map Task ID as the active work unit and keep its state current.
2. Add newly discovered tasks, assumptions, unknowns, constraints, and scope changes instead of silently absorbing them.
3. Link Work and Evidence to the relevant Goal item using `fulfills` and `verifies` relations. Create a decision entry when implementation establishes a meaningful architectural, API, operational, or tradeoff decision; link a superseding decision to the old one with `supersedes` and set the old one's status to `superseded`.
4. Reconcile after a meaningful task, a discovered requirement or risk, a scope or design change, before interruption or handoff, when the human asks for status, and before declaring completion.

Use this fixed reconciliation report and make it agree with the Delivery Map:

```text
Current state
- verified: <n>/<total>
- implemented, unverified: <n>/<total>
- in progress: <n>/<total>
- blocked: <n>/<total>

Goal coverage
- <criterion>: <verified|partial|not started>

Changed assumptions
- <change or None identified>

Human decisions needed
- <decision or None identified>

Next action
- <single next action>
```

## Assure completion

Use a fresh context that did not implement the change to review the Intent Brief, Goal, Delivery Map, actual diff, and Evidence. Do not declare the Goal complete until:

- every Success Criterion has delivery tasks and relevant passing Evidence;
- no `implemented`, `blocked`, or important unknown item is counted as complete;
- the diff respects Constraints and Non-goals;
- specification changes and dropped tasks have reasons and approval sources; and
- the human has accepted the final outcome and that acceptance is recorded as Evidence.

## Update trace

1. Use `belay add goal` for intent, then link Work/Decision entries to it with `fulfills`. Run `belay goal lint <goal-id>` after drafting or materially editing a Goal.
2. Record validation with `belay verify record` and inspect `belay coverage` before release decisions.
3. Run `belay sync` after direct managed Markdown edits. Use terminal statuses (`abandoned`, `rejected`, `superseded`, `archived`) instead of deleting trace history.
4. Entry-body templates live in `TRACE_GUIDE.md`; read it only when authoring an unfamiliar entry type.

## Conflict safety

Never overwrite an unresolved sync conflict. Inspect both sides and use
`belay sync --prefer markdown <id>` or `belay sync --prefer sqlite <id>` only
after the intended source of truth is known.

Repository-specific policy (human gates, review budgeting and round limits,
version control, merge rules) belongs in the repository `AGENTS.md` or
`CLAUDE.md`, not in this generic skill.
