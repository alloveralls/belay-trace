const TOP_LEVEL_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Project commands discover the current repository root and read .belay/config.toml.
  `belay init` creates .belay/ state and tracked support files. It does not modify
  AGENTS.md or install agent skills by default.

Examples:
  belay init
  belay add decision --title "Use SQLite" --body "Keep operational state local."
  belay add goal --title "Reliable sync"
  belay goal lint --all
  belay verify record --kind test --verdict pass --source "cargo test" --summary "all tests passed" --verifies GOAL-...

  6  Storage, filesystem, SQLite, or runtime capability failure

Related Commands:
  Start with `belay init`. Use `belay <command> --help` for command-specific

const INIT_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Creates or completes .belay/config.toml, managed entry directories, local SQLite
  state, .belay/.gitignore, and deterministic agent integration templates. Managed
  generated templates are refreshed. AGENTS.md and agent skills are modified only
  by the explicit --update-agents and --install-skill options.

Examples:
  cd /path/to/repository
  belay init
  belay init --update-agents
  belay init --install-skill codex
  belay init --install-skill claude

Exit Status:
  0  Repository initialized or already complete

  3  Existing configuration is unavailable
  4  Configuration validation failed
  6  Filesystem, SQLite, migration, or runtime capability failure

Related Commands:
  `belay doctor` checks initialized state. `belay add --help` describes entry creation."#;

const ADD_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Creates an entry in SQLite, updates chunks and FTS state, writes its deterministic
  managed Markdown mirror, and records a sync baseline. Goal entries may omit a
  body source; belay then writes the required Goal sections as a template.

Examples:
  belay add decision --title "Use SQLite" --body "Keep operational state local."
  belay add goal --title "Reliable sync"

Exit Status:
  0  Entry created
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Entry type, title, body, or input validation failure
  6  Storage failure

Related Commands:
  `belay link`, `belay status`, `belay show`, and `belay sync`."#;

const LINK_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Adds a validated directional relationship between existing entries. Identical links
  are idempotent. Targets may include Goal item fragments such as #sc-3f9a.
  The source entry revision, mirror, and sync baseline are updated.
  Allowed relations include references, implements, reviews, supersedes,
  follows-up, fulfills, supports, verifies, and refutes.

Examples:
  belay link WRK-20260606T120000-001-schema DEC-20260606T115000-001-sqlite --relation implements

Exit Status:
  0  Link created or already present
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Invalid relation, invalid display ID, or entry not found
  5  Unsynchronized Markdown or SQLite changes require `belay sync`
  6  Storage failure

Related Commands:
  `belay add`, `belay show`, and `belay sync`."#;

const STATUS_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Validates and applies a type-specific status. Setting the current status is an
  idempotent no-op; changes update the entry revision, mirror, and sync baseline.
  Status membership is validated for plan, decision, work, review, and note entries.

Examples:
  belay status DEC-20260606T115000-001-sqlite accepted

Exit Status:
  0  Status updated
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Invalid status, invalid display ID, or entry not found
  5  Unsynchronized Markdown or SQLite changes require `belay sync`
  6  Storage failure

Related Commands:
  `belay show`, `belay link`, and `belay sync`."#;

const SHOW_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Displays one complete entry, its managed source path, and inbound and outbound links
  using display IDs. It does not change repository state.

Examples:
  belay show DEC-20260606T115000-001-sqlite

Exit Status:
  0  Entry displayed
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Invalid display ID or entry not found
  6  Storage failure

Related Commands:
  `belay search` and `belay context`."#;

const SEARCH_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Performs exact display-ID lookup, structured filtering, or deduplicated
  FTS5/BM25-ranked keyword retrieval. Search does not mutate repository state.
  Plain query words are escaped as FTS terms; multiple words match with OR.

Examples:
  belay search "sqlite migration"
  belay search --type decision --status accepted
  belay search --id DEC-20260606T115000-001-sqlite

Exit Status:
  0  Search completed, including no matches
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Query, filter, or limit validation error
  6  Storage or runtime capability failure

Related Commands:
  `belay show` and `belay context`."#;

const CONTEXT_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Produces source-attributed context from ranked matches and directly linked entries.
  Selection preserves relevance order, guarantees evidence for every included entry,
  admits a budget-scaled set of candidates, and gives higher-ranked entries a
  larger share of remaining excerpt space. `belay context compile` adds Goal,
  Evidence, constraints, non-goals, and past-failure sections before ranked context.
  Selection uses 90 percent of the requested budget, reserving 10 percent headroom.
  Token estimates use ceil(ASCII UTF-8 bytes / 4) plus non-ASCII scalar count.
  The default budget is 2500; budgets below 64 are rejected.
  This command does not mutate repository state.

Examples:
  belay context "implement repository sync" --format agent --budget 2500
  belay context compile "implement repository sync" --profile task-start --budget 4000

Exit Status:
  0  Context generated
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Empty task or budget validation error
  6  Storage failure

Related Commands:
  `belay search` and `belay show`."#;

const GOAL_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Reviews Goal entries without calling an LLM. Lint performs deterministic checks;
  improve emits a structured bundle for an agent-mediated semantic review.

Examples:
  belay goal lint GOAL-20260701T090000-001-reliable-sync
  belay goal lint --all --format json
  belay goal improve GOAL-20260701T090000-001-reliable-sync --budget 3000

Exit Status:
  0  Goal command completed, including non-strict lint findings
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Invalid goal, strict lint failure, or output validation failure
  6  Storage failure

Related Commands:
  `belay add goal`, `belay context compile`, and `belay coverage`."#;

const VERIFY_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Records append-only Evidence in .belay/evidence/*.ndjson and indexes it in SQLite.
  Evidence is linked to Goal, Decision, Work, or Goal item references and is never
  edited in place; updates are represented by new records.

Examples:
  belay verify record --kind test --verdict pass --source "cargo test" --summary "all tests passed" --verifies GOAL-...
  belay verify import --junit target/junit.xml --verifies WRK-...
  belay verify status GOAL-...

Exit Status:
  0  Evidence command completed
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Invalid evidence, target, or file
  6  Storage or filesystem failure

Related Commands:
  `belay coverage`, `belay doctor`, and `belay rebuild`."#;

const COVERAGE_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Computes Goal Coverage for active Goals, separating link-based traceability from
  fresh passing Evidence-backed verification. `--fail-under verified=N` can be used
  as a CI gate and returns exit status 4 on failure.

Examples:
  belay coverage
  belay coverage GOAL-20260701T090000-001-reliable-sync
  belay coverage --format json --fail-under verified=60

Exit Status:
  0  Coverage computed and thresholds satisfied
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Invalid target or fail-under threshold not met
  6  Storage failure

Related Commands:
  `belay goal lint`, `belay verify status`, and `belay context compile`."#;

const SYNC_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Reconciles SQLite with managed Markdown using the last successful sync hashes.
  Markdown-only changes are imported, SQLite-only changes are rendered, missing
  counterparts are restored, and conflicts preserve both sides. Batch sync is
  atomic per entry. Explicit --prefer resolution is entry-scoped.

Examples:
  belay sync
  belay sync DEC-20260606T115000-001-sqlite
  belay sync --prefer markdown DEC-20260606T115000-001-sqlite
  belay sync --prefer sqlite DEC-20260606T115000-001-sqlite

Exit Status:
  0  Sync completed
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Invalid Markdown, path, duplicate ID, or other validation error
  5  Conflict requiring explicit resolution
  6  Storage failure

Related Commands:
  `belay doctor`, `belay rebuild`, and `belay show`."#;

const REBUILD_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Validates every managed Markdown entry before creating a temporary replacement
  database. Restores entries, links, chunks, FTS, and fresh sync baselines. The
  active database is replaced only after the temporary database is complete.

Examples:
  belay rebuild

Exit Status:
  0  Database rebuilt
  2  Invalid invocation
  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Mirror, relationship, or schema validation error
  6  Filesystem or SQLite failure

Related Commands:
  `belay sync` and `belay doctor`."#;

const EXPORT_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Writes a filtered point-in-time artifact outside the managed Markdown mirror.
  Markdown output is a combined human-readable snapshot; JSON is one document
  with an entries array; NDJSON writes one entry per line. Export reads SQLite
  and never changes entries, mirrors, revisions, indexes, or sync baselines.

Examples:
  belay export markdown --output ./artifacts/belay-export.md
  belay export json --type decision --status accepted --output ./artifacts/decisions.json
  belay export ndjson --tag release --output ./artifacts/release.ndjson

Exit Status:

  3  Repository not initialized
  4  Filter, display ID, or destination validation error
  6  Filesystem or SQLite failure

Related Commands:
  `belay search`, `belay show`, and `belay rebuild`."#;

const DOCTOR_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"Behavior and Side Effects:
  Performs read-only checks for configuration, current SQLite schema, FTS5/BM25,
  managed Markdown validity, duplicate IDs, path rules, sync drift, orphaned
  temporary files, and generated or active agent integration.

Examples:
  belay doctor

Exit Status:
