## Current State
- Fact: The handoff snapshot contains the prior 12 changed paths plus this Note.
- Fact: Local bookmark `agent/configure-agent-models` points to commit `7adea6cb`.
- Fact: GitHub PR #24 is OPEN and Draft; checks are passing and review is required.
- Fact: The remote branch contains the same commit `7adea6cb661e80b6efe8a2bd412930b9c373d183`.
- Fact: `belay doctor` passed; managed Markdown, SQLite drift, references, Goal sections, and Evidence freshness are valid.
- Fact: The working copy is clean after Push.
- Unknown: Existing Goal coverage still reports one unrelated monitoring gap; no new monitoring evidence was added here.
- Next action: On the next machine, run `jj git fetch`, inspect PR #24, and continue from the clean bookmark.
