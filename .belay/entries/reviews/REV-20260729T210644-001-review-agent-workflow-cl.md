## Review Method

- method: subagent-review
- reviewer: fresh replacement sub-agent, gpt-5.6-terra, high reasoning
- scope: revision `stlqmplm`; source, tests, generated artifacts, acceptance criteria
- requires_human_review: false

## Findings

- blocking, addressed: `AGENTS.md` final validation still used `belay sync 2>&1 | grep -v ': unchanged'`, which was redundant and could hide a failing sync exit code through the pipeline.
  - Resolution: changed the command to plain `belay sync`.
- non-blocking: none.

## Risks

- Unknown: private external scripts may parse the old sync line output.
- Existing nonASCII display IDs remain parseable; only new slug generation changes.

## Validation Assessed

- Rust 1.87 fmt and clippy passed.
- Rust 1.87 all-target tests passed: 125.
- working-copy doctor passed.
- Goal coverage verified decision, implementation, test, and monitoring.

## Positive Findings

- AGENT_SNIPPET is a short Tier 2/3 Skill pointer with context fallback.
- Shared Skill contains the canonical command reference and Token discipline.
- sync aggregation, ASCII 24-character slug fallback, generated equality, and unchanged existing ID parsing match the contract.
- `goal.rs` is unchanged.

## Follow-up

- No second independent review is required; remediation is localized documentation cleanup.
