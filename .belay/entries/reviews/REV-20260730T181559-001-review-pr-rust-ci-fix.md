## Method

- Independent fresh-context diff review.

## Findings

- No code findings.
- Initial Work-entry formatting and sync observations were addressed before final validation.

## Positive Findings

- Installed Codex and Claude Skills byte-match the canonical generated templates.
- The change is limited to the two stale tracked Skill files plus trace records.

## Validation Reviewed

- Rust 1.87 fmt, Clippy, and 135 tests passed.
- Rebuild and doctor passed with both Skills active.

## Outcome

- Approved after final validation; human review is not additionally required.
