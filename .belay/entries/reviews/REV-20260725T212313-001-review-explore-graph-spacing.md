## Review Method

- focused-high-review in a fresh subagent context
- Reviewed latest jj diff, vendored Cytoscape.js 3.34.0 option handling, Work entry, and prior activation change.

## Findings

- No blocking implementation finding.
- Confirmed `idealEdgeLength`, `nodeRepulsion`, `componentSpacing`, and `nodeDimensionsIncludeLabels` accept the configured values.
- Confirmed initial layout and post-expansion relayout use the same factory.
- No change to tap/dbltap arbitration, Explore API, read-only behavior, or Accessible Goal list.

## Risks

- Unknown: visual balance in a real browser because browser execution is unavailable in this environment.
- COSE keeps `fit: true`; at the maximum graph size, wider logical spacing may result in additional zoom-out and smaller labels.
- Human visual inspection is recommended; numeric values remain localized and reversible.

## Validation Reviewed

- JavaScript syntax passed.
- Rust 1.87 formatting, clippy, and 123 all-target tests passed.

## Outcome

Approved as a Tier 1 implementation with no blocking code finding. Visual tuning may follow user inspection.
