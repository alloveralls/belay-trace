## Review Method

- Independent fresh-context focused review of the AGENTS.md policy diff and copy validation.

## Outcome

- Completed with two blocking findings and one non-blocking finding; all addressed in one consolidated remediation pass.

## Blocking Findings

- Fixed: Final Validation applied Belay commands to Tier 1 despite its trace-free default. Split universal jj checks from Tier 2/3 Belay checks.
- Fixed: Tier 3 security review wording implied a second review round that conflicted with the remediation-only second-round rule. Security focus is now part of the first Tier 3 review.

## Non-blocking Findings

- Fixed: belay-trace-specific release versioning propagated to copied repositories. The rule now applies only when the repository contains the root Rust belay-trace package.

## Validation Reviewed

- Three AGENTS.md files had identical SHA-256 hashes before remediation.
- Each file had one managed marker pair and the end marker was the final line.
- After remediation, belay doctor passed and all three files remained identical with one final managed block.

## Human Review

- requires_human_review: false

## Follow-up

- No second independent review is justified because remediation only clarifies policy scope and does not change architecture, API, security behavior, migration, rollback, or production operations.
