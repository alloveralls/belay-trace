## Review

- Method: independent fresh-context implementation review.
- Outcome: approved; no blocking or high findings remain.
- Findings addressed: Applying recovery, receipt state reconstruction, stale revision retry, external inbound drift, Evidence and Coverage basis drift.
- Focused regression coverage: Changed and Unchanged receipt resume, Failed Reconciliation persistence, non-overwriting same-hash retry, external inbound rejection, and Coverage basis rejection.
- Validation reviewed: Rust 1.87 fmt, clippy, and 135 all-target tests passed.
- Evidence: EVD-20260730T061625-001.
- Provenance limitation: Evidence `commit_sha` identifies Git HEAD, not the uncommitted jj working-copy state reviewed here.
- requires_human_review: true
