## Review Method

- focused-high-review in a fresh subagent context
- Reviewed latest jj diff, Goal, Plan, Work, Decision, validation output, and Evidence.
- requires_human_review: true

## Findings

- Resolved: E2E initially waited only for canvas existence and could click before initial Goal loading/layout. Added an aria-busy lifecycle and readiness wait.
- Resolved: expand initially allowed duplicate requests while the same node was in flight. Added a per-node loading Set.
- No remaining High or Medium implementation findings.
- Remaining verification gap: Playwright interaction assertions did not run because Chromium aborted before startup with a macOS Mach port permission denial.

## Risks and Recommendations

- Unknown: real-browser stability across mouse, trackpad, and the 250ms boundary.
- This is a hypothesis pending E2E: using Cytoscape's configured multi-click window fully resolves Issue #15 on supported pointer devices.
- Run the Playwright suite in a browser-capable environment, record passing Goal-linked Evidence, then request human acceptance.

## Validation Reviewed

- JavaScript syntax checks passed.
- Rust 1.87 fmt, clippy, and 123 all-target tests passed after review fixes.
- Playwright test discovery succeeded, but browser launch failed before assertions.

## Positive Findings

- Per-node timer replacement and identity checks prevent stale callbacks.
- dbltap and pagehide cancel pending activation.
- Per-node in-flight expansion is deduplicated.
- Accessible Goal links and Enter activation remain present.
- No Explore API, route, data model, vendored asset, layout, or read-only constraint changes.

## Outcome

Implementation is reviewable with no blocking code finding. Goal completion remains blocked on passing interaction Evidence and human acceptance.

## Post-CI Follow-up

- PR #16 GitHub Actions ran the Playwright interaction assertions successfully in a browser-capable environment.
- EVD-20260725T134154-001 records passing CI against SC-004.
- EVD-20260725T220721-001 records human acceptance of the corrected activation behavior.
- PR #16 was squash merged after separate approval and Issue #15 was closed.
- The review-time verification gap is resolved; no blocking finding remains for Goal completion.
