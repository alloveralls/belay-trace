## Intent Brief

### Problem
- Trace history pollutes `context compile`, IDs must be fully canonical, compile always needs a query, and a task read still costs a whole Plan plus a missed Intent Brief. Light models leave Unknowns in the Map.

### Desired Outcome
- Archived entries drop out of default search and compile. Unique prefix/slug IDs work. No-arg compile is the live working set with a Next index. `--focus` returns a task packet. The Skill states the Frame/Map quality bar.

### Success Signals
- Incomplete unique IDs resolve; ambiguous ones fail with candidates.
- Archived Goal/Plan/Decision/Work/Review/Note are hidden from default search/compile and visible with an opt-in.
- `belay context compile` with no task lists live work and the next Delivery Map row.
- `--focus PLN-...#t-001` is smaller than `show` of the Plan and still carries Constraints and Non-goals.
- Generated Skill documents the new retrieval forms.

### Constraints
- Deterministic core; no LLM in belay.
- No fragment-standard, Route, or FTS-ranking change.
- No silent FTS fallback for ID resolution.
- Do not edit `.agent-safety/`.

### Non-goals
- Auto archive apply. Embeddings. `belay task`. Model names in belay. doctor overload. `plan improve`.

### Assumptions
- Human accepted the overlay-all-types archive model and working-set compile (not a separate next-task command).
- `completed` stays in default compile until archived.

### Unknowns / Decisions Needed
- None identified

## T-001
- **Objective**: Resolve unique display-id prefixes and slugs for CLI-facing show, status, link, lint, and context seed/focus.
- **Scope**: in — store resolve helper, clap ID args. out — Route stored IDs, FTS fallback.
- **Steps**: split optional fragment; exact match; unique prefix; unique slug; echo canonical; fail 0 or 2+.
- **Acceptance**: SC-001.
- **Verification**: unit tests plus CLI `show`/`status` with prefix and slug.

## T-002
- **Objective**: Allow `archived` on every entry type and hide it from default search and context.
- **Scope**: in — allows_status, search/context exclude, `--include-archived`. out — Route, auto-apply.
- **Steps**: extend allowlists; inject exclude unless include-archived or `--status archived`; keep `show` visible.
- **Acceptance**: SC-002.
- **Verification**: status transition tests; search omits archived by default.

## T-003
- **Objective**: List deterministic archive candidates without changing status.
- **Scope**: in — `belay archive candidates`. out — LLM judgment, doctor.
- **Steps**: terminal status, no live inbound link, superseded old side; print reason codes.
- **Acceptance**: SC-003.
- **Verification**: CLI fixture with completed unlinked vs live-linked entries.

## T-004
- **Objective**: No-arg context / context compile builds the live working set plus Next index.
- **Scope**: in — parse_context_task empty, live seeds. out — BM25 over all history as the primary seed.
- **Steps**: seed live statuses; Next from in-progress else first not-started; exclude archived.
- **Acceptance**: SC-004.
- **Verification**: CLI no-arg compile contains live plan task and omits archived.

## T-005
- **Objective**: `--focus` compiles a task packet: Brief slices, task, SC, recent Evidence.
- **Scope**: in — compile --focus. out — whole-plan dump.
- **Steps**: resolve focus; extract Intent Brief sections; task fragment; mapped Goal item; evidence status.
- **Acceptance**: SC-005.
- **Verification**: packet contains Constraints and the task, not sibling tasks.

## T-006
- **Objective**: Update SHARED_SKILL command reference, token discipline, archive workflow, and Frame/Map quality bar.
- **Scope**: in — src/agent.rs SHARED_SKILL, README. out — `.agent-safety/` edits.
- **Steps**: document no-arg compile, --focus, unique IDs, archive candidates, stop on open Unknowns.
- **Acceptance**: SC-006.
- **Verification**: `belay init` generated skill contains the new forms.
