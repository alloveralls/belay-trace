Added a guarded multi-project update script that builds this checkout, refreshes generated assets, preserves existing AGENTS/Codex/Claude activation, optionally enables integrations or rebuilds state, and runs doctor. Added integration tests for activation preservation and explicit initialization.

## Completion

- The updater and explicit integration activation remain part of the current workflow.
- Cross-project use has not produced a material observed need for additional Phase 6 core commands.
- Closure and future reopen conditions are recorded in DEC-20260727T192305-001.
