## Scope

- Add repository-scoped Codex model and agent-role configuration.

## Classification

- Tier 2: bounded, reversible developer-workflow configuration.

## Active Task

- PLN-20260801T221653-001-configure-project-agents#t-005

## Progress

- Existing `.codex` directory confirmed absent.
- Public Codex manual confirms project custom agents and per-agent model settings.
- Added Sol low primary configuration and explicit implementer, reviewer, and high-risk reviewer registrations.
- Added Luna low bounded implementer, Sol low reviewer, and Sol high high-risk reviewer.
- Added role-based delegation and reasoning rules to AGENTS.md.
- Independent review found one blocking policy conflict and one placement issue; both were fixed.

## Validation

- Passed: all four project TOML files parse successfully.
- Passed: every registered custom-agent config file exists.
- Passed: independent review acceptance criteria after remediation.
- Unknown: runtime custom-agent discovery because Codex CLI 0.146.0 cannot load the existing user-global `~/.codex/config.toml`; global configuration is outside this work scope.
