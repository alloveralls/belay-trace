## Scope

- Add repository-scoped Claude Code model and agent-role configuration.

## Classification

- Tier 2: bounded, reversible developer-workflow configuration.

## Active Task

- PLN-20260801T223214-001-configure-claude-agents#t-005

## Progress

- Confirmed Claude Code 2.1.220 and existing local settings.
- Confirmed official project subagent, model, effort, and settings formats.
- Added shared Opus low settings and Sonnet low implementer.
- Added Opus low reviewer and Opus high high-risk reviewer with read-only tool sets.
- Imported AGENTS.md from CLAUDE.md while preserving the complete RTK block.
- Actual Claude reviewer discovery and execution succeeded.
- Round 1 findings were remediated; the second and final review approved with no blocking findings.

## Validation

- Passed: Claude Code doctor loaded project settings; only sandbox Keychain access warned.
- Passed: `.claude/settings.local.json` has no diff.
- Passed: independent Claude reviewer final verdict approved.
- Passed: implementer and high-risk-reviewer were independently discovered and executed with tools disabled.
- Passed: final Belay doctor, coverage, jj status, and jj diff checks.
- Passed: managed belay-trace block remains the final AGENTS.md line.
