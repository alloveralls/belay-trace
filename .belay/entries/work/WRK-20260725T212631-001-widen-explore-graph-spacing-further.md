Tier 1 follow-up to WRK-20260725T212012-001 based on human visual feedback. Increase the three cose spacing values by 50 percent while preserving label-aware dimensions, interaction behavior, API, and read-only constraints. Validate syntax, Rust tests, and independent focused review.

## Validation

- Passed: JavaScript syntax, Rust 1.87 fmt and clippy.
- Passed: all 123 Rust tests.
- Passed: REV-20260725T212827-001-review-wider-explore-graph-spacing; no blocking finding.
- Unknown: real-browser visual balance and large-graph zoom-out.
