Tier 1 visual tuning selected by the human after iterative inspection. Final values are idealEdgeLength 36, nodeRepulsion 768, and componentSpacing 45 with label-aware dimensions retained. The uneven reduction is intentional visual tuning; these cose parameters have distinct roles and do not require equal ratios. Validation: JavaScript syntax, Rust 1.87 fmt and clippy, and all 123 Rust tests passed. Independent review found no blocking issue. The remaining full-file JavaScript diff is formatter-only outside the three numeric values.
